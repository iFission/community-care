# community-care

## Short description
Currently, responses to accidents are triggered by active calls to first responders. In the event of an unforeseen accident and the victim is not able to reach their phone or emergency device, it could prove lethal. Our solution addresses these unforeseen incidents through the use of non-intrusive IoT sensors and the IBM tech stack to engage Community First Responders to streamline and augment the aid process. Since we are using IoT sensors, we are able to generate passive alerts that do not require the intervention of the potential victim.
